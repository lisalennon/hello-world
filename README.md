This is the initial repository that GitHub uses to teach newbies how to use GitHub.
Hello World,
The world of teachers is a strange one.  We try to help students despite the resistance on their part to be helped.  They want and don't want, all in the same breath.
Why do they sign up for classes they don't want?  It seems that, by the time they are in high school, they should know how to act in public.  Ugh!  Guess it hasn't been the best day.
I hope tomorrow will be better.  I know Thursday will be better, because certain students will not be here.
