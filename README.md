# hello-world
This is the initial repository that GitHub uses to teach newbies how to use GitHub.
Hello World,
The world of teachers is a strange one.  We try to help students despite the resistance on their part to be helped.
Why do they sign up for classes they don't want?  Why do they think we are personally responsible for the content?
Ugh!  Guess it hasn't been the best day.
I hope tomorrow will be better.
